# Salesforce Custom Object Viewer

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to log in and view a custom Salesforce object that is synced with database records.

## Prerequisites

- Access to Salesforce with the necessary permissions to view the custom object.
- Salesforce credentials (username and password).
- The custom object should already be created and synced with the database records.

## Steps to Log In and View the Custom Object

### 1. Log in to Salesforce

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the Salesforce login page: [Salesforce Login](https://login.salesforce.com).
2. Enter your Salesforce username and password.
3. Click the `Log In` button.

### 2. Access the Custom Object

1. Once logged in, click on the `App Launcher` (the grid icon) in the top left corner of the screen.
2. In the search bar, type the name of your custom object (e.g., `MyCustomObject`).
3. Click on the custom object from the search results to open it.

### 3. View the Records

1. After opening the custom object, you will be directed to the `Object Home` page.
2. You will see a list of records associated with the custom object.
3. Click on any record to view its details.

### 4. Verifying Sync with Database Records

1. Ensure that the records displayed in Salesforce match the records in your database.
2. If there are any discrepancies, check the sync process and logs to diagnose any issues.

## Additional Information

- **Custom Object Permissions**: Ensure that your Salesforce profile has the necessary permissions to view the custom object.
- **Sync Process**: Make sure that the sync process between the Salesforce custom object and your database is running correctly. This might involve scheduled jobs, API calls, or other integration methods.

## Troubleshooting

- **Login Issues**: If you are unable to log in, ensure that your username and password are correct. You may need to reset your password if youâ€™ve forgotten it.
- **Access Issues**: If you cannot see the custom object, verify that you have the required permissions. Contact your Salesforce admin for assistance.
- **Data Discrepancies**: If the data in Salesforce does not match the database, check the integration settings and logs to identify any issues.
